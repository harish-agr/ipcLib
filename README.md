# ipcLib


This lib aims to be a plug-and-play posix-msg-queue implementation.
All you have to do is to include the ipc.h, call the ipcInit(exename) and you are ready to go.

Some things, like the IPC_ROOT-symbol have to be made generic, and an example app will be provided in the next couple of days.
